    "## Reliability Field maps:  \n",
    "Field maps show the contribution of the intra (x-axis) and inter (y-axis) variation to the ICC in a two dimensional histogram.\n",
    "\n",
    "The field maps can be created using any measurable variable, but we focus on edges from a functional connectivity matrix. For a given edge, we plot the intra- and inter-variation on the x- and y-axis respectively revealing ICC (intra- and between-variation) via diagonal lines originating from point 0,0 in a rainbow-like manner. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Gradient flow vectors:\n",
    "Built upon the variability field map, we also utilize the variability gradient flow map (GFM) for assessing the relative impact of reliability optimizations focused on one form of variation versus the other, depending on the current balance of the intra- and inter-individual variations. This allows us to identify how and where the difference in variability between two conditions changes in an optimal or sub-optimal direction towards the highest \n",
    "\n",
    "The gradient vector on the field map represents the optimal direction for maximal ICC change on the respective axes of individual variability. For a given ICC change, we normalized its gradient by the contributions of individual variability as compared to the optimal direction\n"
